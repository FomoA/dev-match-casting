# ValentineStack 💘🎬

**The "Romantic" Compatibility Engine for Developers.**

> *"Finding the right partner is hard. Finding the right Tech Stack is harder."*

## 🍿 The Concept
Built for **Valentine's Day**, this interactive web application explores the relationship between a Developer and their Technology. 

Drawing from my background as a **Filmmaker** turned **Full Stack Developer**, I designed this experience as a "Casting Call". You are the Director, the Tech is the Star. Will you create a Box Office Hit or a Direct-to-DVD disaster?

## 🚀 Live Demo

## 🛠️ Tech Stack & Features
This project focuses on **Vanilla JavaScript** fundamentals and creative **UI/UX Design**. No heavy frameworks, just clean code.

* **Core:** HTML5, CSS3, Vanilla JavaScript (ES6+).
* **Design:** Custom "Cinematic" Aesthetic (Film Grain, Glassmorphism, CSS Animations).
* **API:** Integrated [DiceBear API](https://www.dicebear.com/) for dynamic avatar generation based on inputs.
* **Algorithm:** Custom hashing logic to determine deterministic "compatibility scores" based on string values.

## 📸 Preview
* **Input:** Enter your name and select a Tech Stack (React, Java, Excel...).
* **Process:** The system calculates a unique hash score.
* **Output:** Visual feedback, confetti animations, and a "Movie Review" of your relationship.
